``l10n_ec_sri_reports`` Module
==============================

Description
-----------

The ``l10n_ec_sri_reports`` module is specifically developed to handle
and automate the preparation and submission of key tax reports required
by Ecuador's Internal Revenue Service (SRI). This module facilitates
compliance with Ecuadorian tax laws by efficiently generating the
following reports:

-  **Anexo Transaccional Simplificado (ATS)**: A comprehensive report
   summarizing all financial transactions within a specific period.
-  **Formulario 103**: A report used for VAT declarations.
-  **Formulario 104**: A report for income tax declarations.

This module integrates seamlessly with other Odoo modules to ensure that
all financial data is accurately reflected in the reports, enabling
businesses to meet their tax obligations effectively.
